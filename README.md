# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System using DBSCAN Clustering This is a Movie Recommendation System built using the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) machine learning algorithm. The system is designed to recommend movies based on a given movie input, leveraging unsupervised learning for clustering similar movies.
The system uses a movie dataset containing various attributes of movies (e.g., name, genre, ratings, etc.). The movies are pre-clustered using DBSCAN based on these features to allow efficient and meaningful recommendations.
